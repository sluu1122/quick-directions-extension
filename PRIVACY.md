# Privacy Policy for Quick Directions

**Last updated:** January 28, 2025

## Overview

Quick Directions is a Chrome extension that helps you get Google Maps directions from highlighted text on any webpage. Your privacy is important, and this extension is designed to collect as little data as possible.

## Data Collection

### What we collect

**Saved locations:** When you add a location (like "Home" or "Work"), the name and address you enter are stored using Chrome's built-in sync storage. This data:
- Is stored locally on your device
- Syncs across your Chrome browsers if you're signed into Chrome
- Is never sent to any external servers
- Is never shared with third parties

### What we don't collect

- We do not collect your browsing history
- We do not collect the text you highlight on webpages
- We do not track your usage of the extension
- We do not use analytics or tracking scripts
- We do not collect any personal information

## How the Extension Works

1. You highlight text on a webpage
2. You right-click and select a saved location
3. The extension opens Google Maps with directions from your saved location to the highlighted text
4. The highlighted text is passed directly to Google Maps via URL - it is not stored or transmitted elsewhere

## Data Storage

All data is stored using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` API, which means:
- Data is encrypted in transit
- Data is stored in your Google account if Chrome sync is enabled
- You can delete all data by removing the extension

## Third-Party Services

The extension opens Google Maps (maps.google.com) to display directions. When you use the extension, Google's privacy policy applies to your use of Google Maps: https://policies.google.com/privacy

## Your Rights

You can:
- View your saved locations in the extension settings
- Edit or delete any saved location at any time
- Remove the extension to delete all stored data

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy changes, the updated version will be posted to this page with a new "Last updated" date.
